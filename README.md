# Sorting Algorithms




All mainstream sorting algorithms implemented in C++..

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort simply swaps adjacent items if the two it is looking at are incorrectly ordered.  It continues moving down the list, and will keep on going until everything is sorted



## Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Selection sort works well for small files.

It is used for sorting the files with very large values and small keys. This is because selection is made based on keys and swaps are made only when required.

## Insertion Sort

This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be 'insert'ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, insertion sort

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is an efficient and very popular sorting algorithm. It is basically a divide and conquer algorithm just like the quick sort. So the strategy includes divide, conquer and combine

## Quick Sort 

Quicksort algorithm is a divide and conquer algorithm which sorts the given sequence in place meaning that it doesn't require extra storage as we need in merge sort
